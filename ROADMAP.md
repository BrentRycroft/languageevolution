# ROADMAP — autonomous realism loop

This file is the **durable brain** of the `auto/realism` autonomous loop. After
any context compaction, the next iteration re-orients from THIS file + `git log`
+ `ARCHITECTURE.md`. If this file and the code disagree, the code wins — fix
this file.

## North star

A fully functioning, dynamic-yet-realistic, **language-agnostic**
language-evolution simulator — emergent behaviour that is also typologically
plausible — plus the immersive features that let a user *experience* the
languages it grows, and which keeps getting faster as it grows. Three faces:

1. **Engine** — language change over time across every layer (phonology …
   phylogenetics).
2. **Immersive** — the translator (weak, needs heavy improvement) and narrative
   generation (random words assembled by the language's own grammar via
   universal-grammar rules).
3. **Content** — presets: expand/fix, more words, remove English-based encoding.

## Scope horizons

- **NOW (active):** fast trustworthy green baseline; engine realism; translator
  quality; narrative generation; preset expansion/de-anglicization;
  language-agnosticism; performance improvement.
- **LATER (do NOT build autonomously — keep the door open):** detailed Earth map
  for geographic spread of language families; eventually multiple language
  families simulated at once. Avoid decisions that foreclose these; log a small
  enabling item or a NEEDS DECISION when something would block them.

Non-exhaustive; the user queues more ideas — fold them in here.

## Realism & quality checklist (scoreboard: none / partial / solid)

| Area | State | Gap note |
|------|-------|----------|
| Phonology (sound change) | solid | Mature; also the perf hot path (apply.ts). |
| Phonotactics & prosody | partial | Drift + stress exist; assess depth when touched. |
| Morphology (infl/deriv/fusion/ablaut) | partial | Broad coverage; assess realism per-axis. |
| Syntax (order/alignment/agreement) | partial | Typology axes exist; check agnosticism. |
| Semantics (drift/colex/metaphor) | partial | Colexification + recarve exist; metaphor? assess. |
| Lexicon (coin/borrow/compound/loss) | partial | Strong; compounding depth unassessed. |
| Sociolinguistics (register/prestige/endangerment) | partial | Phase 72 added prestige/endangerment/bilingual. |
| Contact (borrow/creole/areal) | partial | Exists; realism of areal waves unassessed. |
| Phylogenetics (splits/divergence/cognates) | solid | Phase 73 typological divergence. |
| **Translator** | partial | User flagged WEAK — needs heavy improvement. |
| **Narrative generation** | partial | Extensive code; output quality unverified by play. |
| **Presets — coverage** | partial | 6 families: bantu/english/germanic/pie/romance/tokipona. |
| **Presets — word count** | partial | Assess lexicon sizes; user wants many more words. |
| **Presets — de-anglicization** | needs assessment | User wants less English-based encoding. |
| **Language-agnosticism** (cross-cutting) | needs assessment | Audit for baked-in English structure. |
| **Performance** | partial | apply.ts hot path; known optimisation targets open. |
| **UX / GUI** | needs assessment | No play session run yet. |

## Backlog (top = next)

- [x] Trim PR long-pole tests `phase72_code_review_batch_b` and
      `phase73d_direction_vector` to <60s without weakening assertions.
- [ ] Sweep oversized `sim.step()` gen-counts in RUN_SLOW files; reduce where
      the assertion doesn't require them.
- [ ] One clean end-to-end `RUN_SLOW=1 npx vitest run`; fix what it surfaces.
- [ ] Baseline GUI play session (Manual/GUI verification); log under UX findings.
- [ ] Assess translator quality against its tests + a real phrase; scope the
      "heavy improvement" into concrete sub-items.
- [ ] Assess narrative-generation output quality (play session) and
      language-agnosticism of its grammar assembly.
- [ ] Audit presets for English-based encoding; scope de-anglicization.

## Done log

- (baseline) Pre-existing engine fixes + test speedups + two-tier CI + arch-doc
  updates were committed as `853b7ec "yay"` and merged to `main` via PR #176.
  The loop branches `auto/realism` from that point.
- Trimmed the two PR long-pole tests under 60s (test-only): B7 runs a
  non-splitting lineage (intrinsic drift property — tree splitting was
  irrelevant cost+noise), 37.5s→20s; phase73d shares one 60-split sample across
  its five statistical tests via beforeAll (~5× less compute, same power),
  66s→~17s. Both files now <60s; combined wall 80s→50s.
